# Global Instructions

## Architecture Documentation

When architectural context is needed, do not guess. Instead, use your GitHub tools to explore the
`SCF-Public-Goods-Maintenance/scf-public-goods-maintenance.github.io` repository. Start by listing
the `docs/` directory, then read only the .md files relevant to the current task.

## Docs

Always document your work. When the output is code, write clear docstrings for each function. If it
is not obvious where to document your work, create a new .md file.

## Tests

Whenever possible, write test cases to validate your work. Do not hesitate to write unit tests. If
you need to write a larger integration test or GitHub workflow, ask for user input first.
